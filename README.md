# 📊 Profit Performance Analysis

This project explores and analyzes a company’s profit performance using historical sales 
data between January 2013 and December 2014. The goal was to uncover key factors 
affecting profit margins and determine the optimal sales and cost conditions 
needed to meet or exceed the average profit target of $24,133.86.

## 🔍 Objective
- To analyze cost, discount, and pricing structures in order to:
- Understand what drives profitability.
- Determine the minimum number of units required to meet the average profit target.
- Apply accounting prudence by modeling conservative profit scenarios.

## 📂 Files
- `report.pdf` – Final project report, including methodology, formulas, and visualizations.
- `data.csv` – Cleaned and transformed dataset used for analysis and dashboarding.
- `powerbi_dashboard.pbix` – Power BI file containing interactive visualizations. 
- `raw_data.xlsx` – Original dataset with formatting issues and raw values. 

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Excel – Data cleaning, transformation, formula-based analysis
- Power BI – Dashboard creation and profit target visualization
- Accounting Principles – Prudence concept used for modeling risk-averse projections

## 📈 Key Insights
- Selling 13,436 units at a $12 unit price, with a 15% discount and a COGS% of 85.03%, is required to meet the average profit of $24,133.86.
- A formula was developed to dynamically calculate the optimal COGS% based on desired profit and units sold.
- Visualizations highlight how fluctuations in cost of goods sold and discount bands impact total profit.
- The dataset had formatting inconsistencies (e.g., dollar signs, incorrect comma placement) that were cleaned using Excel formulas like SPLIT, VALUE, SUBSTITUTE, and custom date concatenation logic.
